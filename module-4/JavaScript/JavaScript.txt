1. What is JavaScript Object?
Ans: A JavaScript object is a fundamental data structure in JavaScript, allowing you to store and manipulate data in a key-value pair format. Objects are enclosed in curly braces ‘{}’ and consist of properties and methods.

Example:

Const person = {
	firstName: “Amar”,
	lastName: “patel”,
	age: 30,
	isStudent: false,
	sayHello: function() {
		console.log(“Hello!”);
	}
};
In this example, ‘person’ is an object with properties like ‘firstName’, ‘lastName’, ‘age’ and ‘isStudent’.
It also ha a method ‘sayHello’, which is a function attached to the object. You can access properties and methods of an object using dot notation, like ‘person.fisrtName’ or ‘person.sayHello()’.
